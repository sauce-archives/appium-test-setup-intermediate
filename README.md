# appium-test-setup-intermediate
A setup that allows you to run tests on the TestObject platform, exemplified through two basic tests on the [Calculator app](https://github.com/aluedeke/calculator) by Andreas LÃ¼deke. It differs from the [basic setup](https://github.com/testobject/appium-test-setup-basic/) in that it registers the results of said tests so the user can see them through the online UI.
